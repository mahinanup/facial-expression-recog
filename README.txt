1.Developed a facial expression recognition model in Keras.
2.Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) with 4 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers to predict 7 types of facial expressions.
3.Deployed the trained model to a web interface with Flask.
4.This model can be appplied to real-time video streams and image data.
